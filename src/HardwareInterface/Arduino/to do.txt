collected feedback on mega very shaky - possible fixes:
	if mega sends new length command, only receive feedback a limited number of times
	and stop listening after movement should be finished
	check if it turned into the right direction on mega

------------------------
mega:
conversiong pwm feedback to feedback length
	does it make sense, to switch crossingFeedback to int as well?


still shaky feedback on Mega, always decreasing and shaky
stop sending pulse on nano, if pulse already been sent

error / warning sequence 

mega crossing detection feedback


mega:
feedback jumps only when lengthCommand comes in
 - pwmFeedback 1018 diff 0 angle 0.00 test 0 lastLength: 4539 f11bb
 - pwmFeedback 1019 diff 1 angle 1.42 test 1 lastLength: 4353 f1101
 - pwmFeedback 1028 diff 9 angle 12.74 test 11 lastLength: 4364 f110c
 - pwmFeedback 1170 diff 0 angle 0.00 test 0 lastLength: 4544 f11c0

crossing detection on mega -> keep track of # of revolution
	use array of circumference to change radius

does nano exit crossing?
	exit crossing after x amount of loops in velocity mode




testing:

feedback
	nano
	mega


----------------------
NANO CROSSING
pwmDifference / 40 for determining how many loops max -> improve later by calculating
value instead of 4 from max speed and also direction


crossing on nano
	pwm difference correct?
	counter correct?
