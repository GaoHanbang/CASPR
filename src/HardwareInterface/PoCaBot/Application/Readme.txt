This is a simple introduction for the application:
1.Do not modify the 'initstate.ini' because it is needed to run the program and the code will change the content accordingly. Now there are nine numbers in it, the first eight ones of which are record for the initial position of the motors when they are ready for tasks. The last number is for constrution task only which means the numerical order of the next brick the robot will work on.
2.In the example.m there are a couple of simple testing programs which you can run for different tests. Different tests are seperated with indicator '%%'. For more information, please read the comments.
3.Most applications here refer to the hardware operation. Here is an important tip for running the hardware to avoid unnecessary troubles: the commands for opening and closing the COM port should be executed on a one to one basis otherwise some errors will take place. For example, in the file named 'constructing.m', the statement 'exp.application_preparation(fo,q0);' could open the port while the statement 'exp.application_termination();' could release the port. So before you re-execute the open command, please make sure that the port has been released to avoid error. 
4.Do not use 'clear' randomly. If you lose the handle to the experiment instance and fail to release the port, then the port is still held in MATLAB's memory, at this point, the only solution is to restart MATLAB and re-plug the USB2Dynamixel.
5.In the program, I usually use the statement like 'if ~exist('exp','var')' to save the initializing time which is considerably long. So if you want to re-creat the instance of this class, please clear the relevant variable manually.
6.Before you start to run a program, please check the main parameters listed below: the name of the com port, baud rate of the com port, ID of cable set, the weight of the end effector etc.

Should you have any suggestion on improving the program, please talk to me. Thank you very much!
